This paper is about harassment on social media and how categorize it using machine learning and NLP techniques. We reached scores above 0.80 of accuracy for all the harassment types in the data. We also showed that, when using TFIDF vectors, Linear and Gaussian SVM are the best methods to predict
harassment content, while Decision Trees and Random Forest better categorize physical and sexual harassment. Overall, by using TF-IDF vectors
presented higher performance on these data, suggesting that the training corpus for Word2Vec influenced negatively on the classification task
outcomes.
