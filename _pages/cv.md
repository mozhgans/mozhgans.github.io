Education
======

* Postdoc  Stanford University, 2023
* Ph.D   Dalhousie University, Vector Institute, University of Toronto 2022

Work experience
======
* Summer 2008: Statistical Intern Analyst
  * Sepahan Data Mining Company
  * Duties included: Interpreting patterns of data, determining analysis parameters, processing data, analyzing data and creating visualizations for data interpretation.
  

* Fall 2009-2012: Teaching Assistant
  * Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Amir Kabir University
  * Duties included: Preparing and Delivering lectures; Courses: Linear Algebra course, Data Structure


* Fall 2015: Teaching Assistant
  * Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Sharif University
  * Duties included: Preparing and Delivering lectures; Courses: Design and Analysis of Algorithms, Cloud Computing, Software Development, Serverless Data Processing, PPL, Graph Theory, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Data Structures & Algorithms.





* Fall 2017: Research Assistant
  * Noavar Research Company
  * Duties included: improving measurements for the service identification, and service-oriented architecture.
 

* Fall 2018: Research Assistant
  * Dalhousie University, Canada
  * My research is in the field of Machine learning, Algorithms, NLP, and Data Mining on Wikisim project, using Deep ML algorithms for problems of Word Sense Disambiguation and Wikification. We perform message-passing of Network Coding through a graph neural network representation of the Knowledge Base, using
different embeddings and Large Language Models.
  * Supervisor: Evangelos Milios, and Norbert Zeh



* Fall 2021: Applied Machine Learning intern
  * Vector Institute for AI, Toronto
  *  was an applied machine learning intern.
Our project was developing and enhancing a recommendation system working with the Reddit dataset. Later, we used the GitHub dataset as well to train our models.
In our model, we used large language models to enhance the performance of the representations.
  * Supervisor: Ron Bodkin


* Spring-Winter 2022: Research and Teaching Assistant
  * University of Toronto, UHN, and Vector Institute
  * I have been a research and teaching assistance for the course of “Clinicians Champions in AI”, and also a teaching assistant for the course of “NRCan AI Fundamentals”. My roles include developing course materials and delivering the content to participant, and supervising the projects.

  * Team: Devin Singh, Sedef Kocak, Saman Doroodgar, Flora Wan. 


* Fall 2023: Postdoctoral Research Scientist
  * Stanford University, Palo Alto, California
  *  My research focuses on applying natural language processing and deep learning
generative models to analyze textual and image data alongside gene expression
information. The models we work with in our projects include inverse reinforcement learning, self-improvement, world models, and meta-learning.
  * Supervisor: Barbara Engelhardt
