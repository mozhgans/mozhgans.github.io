I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in Computer Science and Bioinformatics at Stanford University and Gladstone Institute, working with Barbara Engelhardt. Before joining Engelhardt's lab, I was a PhD student in Computer Science, Machine Learning, and NLP. 

<!-- #I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Department of Biomedical Data Science at Stanford University, working with Barbara Engelhardt. -->

<!-- #Prior to my current position, I was a Postdoctoral Research Scientist at the Machine Learning and Optimization (MLO) lab at EPFL, working with Martin Jaggi. #While at EPFL, I organized the Smooth Games reading group. In part of my time, I participated in the intelligent Global Health (iGH) sub-group of MLO led #by Mary-Anne Hartley, by advising on the machine learning aspect of the ongoing projects. I obtained my Ph.D. from EPFL, and Idiap, supervised by FranÃ§ois #Fleuret. During my Ph.D. studies I did two internships at: (i) Mila where I was supervised by Yoshua Bengio and Simon Lacoste-Julien, as well as at (ii) #DeepMind supervised by Irina Higgins. -->



Research Interest
======

My main interests are at the intersection of machine learning for healthcare and statistical genetics. 
<!-- #My research aims to better understand the training dynamics of multi-player games and develop improved methods for their optimization.  -->
In addition, my broader interests include statistical modeling, graph theory, combinatorics, deep learning, and NLP.

Other
======
I am very passionate about cultivating a diverse and inclusive ML and Statistic community, and I am actively part of the organizing team of WiML. Outside work, I enjoy hiking, biking, stand-up paddling, morning runs, and gardening. I love traveling to places with distinct nature and beautiful landscapes.
